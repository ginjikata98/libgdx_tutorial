At this point, you may want to add a start menu screen that is displayed before the game begins, as you did in the previous chapter. You may also want to add or modify various features currently in the game. For example, after testing the gameplay, you will likely realize that the game is relatively easy: by spinning in place and shooting lasers as fast as you can, you will win relatively quickly. To address this issue, you could add more rocks, make the rocks smaller, make the rocks faster, or some combination of these features. Alternatively
(or additionally), you may want to limit the rate at which the spaceship can fire lasers. The simplest way
to implement this would be to add another condition in the Spaceship class shoot method that checks if
the number of lasers on the stage exceeds a certain value, in which case it could return from the method immediately (before spawning a new laser object). In addition, you could take inspiration from the original Asteroids game, and when a rock collides with a laser have it spawn two smaller rocks; only if the rocks are “small enough” (if their width or height is less than some particular value) do they get destroyed forever without spawning additional rocks. In addition, to add to the challenge, you could add a new object: a UFO that spawns periodically off-screen and travels in a straight line to the opposite side, destroying the spaceship if it comes into contact with it. Finally, if all these additions make the game too challenging, you could add
a “power-up” feature: a new object called PowerUp that has a random chance of spawning when a rock is destroyed, and if the player collects (collides with) it, the spaceship’s shield power is restored to 100 percent.
In the next chapter, you will turn your attention to user-interface design and displaying text, a fundamental skill you will need to master for game development.
